# willow-bird

willow-bird is a work in progress. It's meant to be a clone of the famous mobile game Flappy Bird. 

The goal of this project is to experiment with OpenGL, sharpen my C++ skill and have a clean codebase or game engine that can be used
as a baseline to work with for future game projects
